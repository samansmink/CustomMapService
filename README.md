## About
This project was created for the Stichting Studiecentrum Criminaliteit en Rechtshandhaving (NSCR). It was created to be able to use a local Nominatim server to be able to use LimeSurvey with OpenStreetMap without the need for an Internet connection

## How to use
- install LimeSurvey 2.72.3 or higher
- copy CustomMapService folder to LimeSurvey plugins folder
- go to LimeSurvey admin panel -> configuration -> plugin manager
- configure this plugin to use the XYZ url of your running openmaptiles instance
- configure this plugin to use the url of your running nominatim instance
- enable plugin

## How it works?
It simply replaces the existing OSM initialization. Note that during question creation you wil not be shown this plugin as an option, but instead the OSM by MapBox option should be selected.
